# Movie-Info-Dockerized
Developed a microservice-based movie rating system utilizing key microservice techniques such as service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaker and API gateways (Spring Cloud). Docker was used for containerization, ensuring each service was independently deployed and managed for scalability and isolation. The system enabled users to see movie info and rate movies.
